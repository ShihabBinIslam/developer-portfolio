            <p>As a Web Developer, I aim to create and design different websites for clients. They are responsible for
                their
                aesthetic as well as their function.In this field I'm able to ensure sites are compatible with multiple
                types of media because a Web Developer need to have a firm understanding of programming with significant
                styles</p>
